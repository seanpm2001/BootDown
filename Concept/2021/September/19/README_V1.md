# BootDown

## Concept

### From 2021 September 19th

#### About

BootDown is an experimental operating system project that runs at the BIOs level, but can be a functional CLI or GUI operating system that can read and write files, access hard drives, and so on, before booting into the main operating system.

#### Limitations

Severe limitations will be in place, such as a low file size limit, possibly pushing to partitions, and so on. I will need to research this concept more, this is an experimental project. Also, due to size reasons, multi-lingual support will be unavailable once you install. Each installation will only support 1 language.

Also, due to how basic the project is, don't expect to be able to do things like run a web browser, or using LibreOffice, but expect things like running Pong, Doom, or other games ported to Assembly, VHDL, Verilog, or SystemVerilog.

#### Naming

The project was originally called BL/S or BL/Ss (which stood for BootLoader System or BootLoader Subsystem) but the name was changed to BootDown, as the project is more than just a bootloader. BootDown is in reference to booting down to a lower level system, rather than booting up to a higher level system.

#### Language

This proejct is written in 4 different programming languages:

- [x] Assembly

- [x] VHDL (Virtual Hard Disk Language)

- [x] Verilog

- [x] SystemVerilog

It is supplemented by 3 basic computer languages as well:

- [x] GNU Makefile

- [x] Markdown

- [x] Plain text

Multi-lingual support is currently unavailable, but the project is available in English. To install in a different language, you would have to download a different installation image in your preferred language, as this system is so small that it can only support 1 language at a time.

Currently, the project has been written for the following languages:

- [x] English (US)

#### Logo

The boot from the scuba diver from the SpongeBob SquarePants movie (2004) seemed to fit this project well. I used a low resolution image, but this may not stay, as I want an original logo. I want something that resembles a dark and murky boot.
