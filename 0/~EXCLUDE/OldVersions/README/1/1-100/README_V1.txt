What is this?
---

0 is a read-only directory that contains assembly data for this project, including 2 sample programs.

-*-
HELLOWLD.asm
-*-

Due to the 8:3 file system in use here, I had to exclude 2 letters from the name. It is a basic Hello World program that can be called to test output in Assembly. It has 1 variant, known as Caesar.

-*-
CAESAR.asm
-*-

CAESAR.asm is an alternative to the Hello World program themed around the operating systems basic nature, saying the Line:

et tu, boot?

Which translates from Latin to English as:

You too, bootis?

The bootis part may be wrong, but et tu does translate to you too in Latin. It is a joke program that I considered using in the crash screen for this project.

This README file should not be included in the operating system, along with archives of the first version of each script, as this system operates on very little memory, and the simpler the program/script, the better.
