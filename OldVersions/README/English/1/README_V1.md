Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of March 21st 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/BootDown/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't the intended page. You will be redirected to the [.github folder](/.github/) of this project, where the README translations are hosted.

Translations are currently done with Bing translate and DeepL. Support for Google Translate translations is coming to a close due to privacy concerns.

# BootDown
An experimental operating system project that runs at the BIOs level, but can be a functional operating system.

***

## About

See above. Also see below for more info.

***

## How it works

BootDown is an extension to a bootloader, but it can also be its own bootloader. It is compatible with GRUB2 as a bootloader extension.

BootDown works at the BIOs level, and the system is accessible within a few seconds of pressing the power button (on Solid State Drives) and can be considered a pre-operating system. You are booting down, not booting up.

Due to the simplicity of this boot stage, there are limitations to how BootDown works.

## Known limitations

Here are the known limitations to BootDown, as of Tuesday, 2021 September 21st at 2:06 pm.

### Total memory limitations

BootDown is a Bootloader extension at a very low boot level, thus it can only access 65,536 bytes of storage for its own usage. Other usage must be read from an existing partition.

### Lack of multi-lingual support

This limit prevents BootDown from doing things like having lots of features, one notable loss is the lack of multi-lingual support. You can only have 1 language at a time. You will have to choose the English version if you speak English, but will need to do a separate installation if you want to choose Esperanto, Spanish, German, etc. I don't even know if Chinese language support is possible with the given constraints, due to the Chinese language being so large and complex (over half of the UTF-16 block is just Chinese radicals

### No Internet support

BootDown isn't a traditional operating system, and is being done at the pre-boot stage. This means it can't access API calls or functions needed to connect to the Internet or run a web browser. Bluetooth isn't available either.

### Feature limitations

Features will be split across multiple variants. For example, there will be CLI version A that has a command line plus some features, CLI version B which is the same, but with some other features, GUI version A, which contains a Graphical User Interface and some features, and GUI version B, which is the same, but with some other features, etc.

### Application support limitation

Application support is only available for programs written in x86 Assembly, VHDL, Verilog, or SystemVerilog. C and C++ programs may be possible, but programs written in Python, Java, C#, Go, Kotlin, and many other languages are not supported.

### Other limitations

This is still an experimental project, limitations are still being found.

## Architectures

BootDown is planned to work on most modern hardware platforms, and also most legacy platforms. These include:

* FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array)

* R-PI (Raspberry Pi)

It also is planned to work with:

* BIOs (Basic Input Output system)

* UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)

More architectures will be supported in the future.

***

## Concept

### From 2021 September 19th

#### About BootDown

BootDown is an experimental operating system project that runs at the BIOs level, but can be a functional CLI or GUI operating system that can read and write files, access hard drives, and so on, before booting into the main operating system.

#### Limitations

Severe limitations will be in place, such as a low file size limit, possibly pushing to partitions, and so on. I will need to research this concept more, this is an experimental project. Also, due to size reasons, multi-lingual support will be unavailable once you install. Each installation will only support 1 language.

Also, due to how basic the project is, don't expect to be able to do things like run a web browser, or using LibreOffice, but expect things like running Pong, Doom, or other games ported to Assembly, VHDL, Verilog, or SystemVerilog.

#### Naming

The project was originally called BL/S or BL/Ss (which stood for BootLoader System or BootLoader Subsystem) but the name was changed to BootDown, as the project is more than just a bootloader. BootDown is in reference to booting down to a lower level system, rather than booting up to a higher level system.

#### Language

This project is written in 4 different programming languages:

- [x] Assembly

- [x] VHDL (Virtual Hard Disk Language)

- [x] Verilog

- [x] SystemVerilog

It is supplemented by 3 basic computer languages as well:

- [x] GNU Makefile

- [x] Markdown

- [x] Plain text

Multi-lingual support is currently unavailable, but the project is available in English. To install in a different language, you would have to download a different installation image in your preferred language, as this system is so small that it can only support 1 language at a time.

Currently, the project has been written for the following languages:

- [x] English (US)

#### Logo

The boot from the scuba diver from the SpongeBob SquarePants movie (2004) seemed to fit this project well. I used a low resolution image, but this may not stay, as I want an original logo. I want something that resembles a dark and murky boot.

***

## Software support

Here is the featured software that can work directly off the hardware, without an operating system. Most of these don't require BootDown to be installed, but are planned to pair with it.

## Sample programs

The `///0/` directory has some sample programs and documentation for the BootDown system. Currently, there is a `README.txt` file, and 2 sample programs, 1 is currently not functional.

A Hello World program is available, which is written in Assembly. It is named `HELLOWLD.asm` due to limitations, such as the 8:3 file system.

A modified version of the Hello World program with a Roman Empire joke is included, which is named `CAESAR.asm` but isn't functional yet. Instead of outputting Hello World, it outputs `Et tu, boot?` which is supposed to translate to `You too, bootis?` from Latin. The first 2 words are proper latin, but I am not sure if `boot` would translate to `bootis` this program is not functional, as it has a line with the following data:

```assembly
    stab 23 ; Caesar was stabbed 23 times, although this may not be valid syntax
```

which may not be valid syntax.

## History

This project has a short history so far.

### Pre-history

This project was started on 2021 Sunday September 19th as a concept project that was thought of the same day as its creation. The other concept from this day was the [ScreenTeX project](https://github.com/ScreenTeX/) the concept was partially written down in a private repository, but was made public on 2021 Monday September 20th after I created [the organization for this project](https://github.com/BootDown-dev/). The project was worked on extensively today, and the concept was further implanted. It still isn't functional yet.

### Alpha history

On 2021 Tuesday September 21st, this projects `README.md` file was updated, and it received its own website.

### Beta history

No Beta history to show for this project.

### Modern history

No Modern history to show for this project.

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](/DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am ussing the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman/) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation/)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
